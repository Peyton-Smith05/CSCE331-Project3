### [Description](https://canvas.tamu.edu/courses/251529/pages/project-3-descriptions-and-resources?module_item_id=8193047)

## Requirements

Your product should meet the following requirements:

* Create a web-based application. The application’s primary mode of interaction should be through a browser interface. It must run, at minimum, in Chrome; you may also let it run in other browsers. It should not require any extensions to run in the browser. It will connect to the AWS server and postgreSQL database you created in Project 2.
* Serve 4 different types of users or views: managers, cashiers, customers, and menu boards. The application should adapt to the different needs of each user type. All users are in the store, no mobile app is needed.
* Incorporate 3 existing web services within it: OAuth login,  Google Translate, and a weather service of your choice.
* Address accessibility by complying with WCAG 2.1Links to an external site. and the needs of given persona in your design. (Introduction to Web AccessibilityLinks to an external site. Resource)

## Presentation

Your final product will be presented at the end of the semeter.

* The presentation is a Business Casual presentation where every member should take approximately equal time presenting.
* The goals of this presentation are to show your product and the evolution of your product from the initial design to the current one, and to convince those funding you to continue. (Details on the presentation to come later. This will not affect the project itself, just how you demonstrate it to the class.)

## Environment

You will use an Agile development environment for this project.

* Due to team size, and even more significantly, due to time constraints, we will not be able to follow a “real” agile approach, but we will try to capture some of the main themes from a SCRUM-style development process.
* Time management will be crucial to your success. Requirement changes from your initial design will come from the user studies that you provide.
(No external requirement changes are planned for this project.)

## Management

We will use project managers in this assignment.

* Your team will be asked to hold SCRUM meetings with a choosen SCRUM manager. This manager will be able to earn a possible 10% incentive to their contribution grade.
* The SCRUM manager will meet with the instructor and TA every Friday throughout the duration of the project (except on the Team Meeting week.)
* This approximately 10 minute meeting is to give an update to the instructors and TA's and share what is working and not working with other SCRUM managers.
